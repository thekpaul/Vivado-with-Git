Vivado with Git
===

> Tcl-based, quick and easy template for using Git VCS in Vivado (RTL) projects.
  (Tried and tested on Vivado 2021.2)
>
> Based on [barbedo/vivado-git][fork], a Git-friendly Vivado workflow tried and
  tested on Vivado 2021.2.1

## Requirements

- Tested with Vivado 2021.2.1

### Windows

- [Git for Windows][git-win]:
  Add `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd` (or wherever you have your `git.exe`) to your
  `PATH` (check in CLI with `where.exe git`)

### Linux

- Git

## Installation

> Currently working on an automated setup batch/shell installer

Add `Vivado_init.tcl` (or append the relevant lines if you already have
something in it) along with the `scripts` directory to:

- `%APPDATA%\Xilinx\Vivado` on Windows
- `~/.Xilinx/Vivado` on Linux

## How it works

Vivado is a pain ~~in the ass~~ to source control decently, so these scripts
provide:

- A modified `write_project_tcl_git.tcl` script to generate the project script
  without absolute paths.

- A Git wrapper that recreates the project script and adds it before committing.
  All the Git commands can be used from the Tcl Console on the Vivado GUI.

- A Tcl script (`wproj`) to just create the Tcl project generator script without
  using git. This script can also be called from the Tcl Console on Vivado.
  **This is the prefered way to generate the project generator script if you
  want to handle Git outside Vivado** (like Git from a terminal, VS Code, etc).

## Workflow

1. When first starting a project, create it in a folder called `vivado_project`
  (e.g. `PROJECT_NAME/vivado_project`).
  All the untracked files will be under this directory.

2. Place your source files anywhere you want in your project folder
  (e.g. `PROJECT_NAME/sources`).

  Here is an example of a possible project structure:
  ```
  PROJECT_NAME
      ├── .git/
      ├── .gitignore
      ├── project_name.tcl         # Project generator script
      ├── src/                     # Tracked source files
      │   ├── design/
      │   │    ├── *.v
      │   │    └── *.vhd
      │   ├── testbench/
      │   │    ├── *.v
      │   │    └── *.vhd
      │   └── ...
      ├── ip/                      # Tracked project-specific IP repository
      │   ├── my_first_ip/
      │   │    ├── src/
      │   │    ├── xgui/
      │   │    └── component.xml
      │   ├── my_second_ip/
      │   └── ...
      └── vivado_project/          # Untracked generated files
          ├── project_name.xpr
          ├── project_name.cache/
          ├── project_name.hw/
          ├── project_name.sim/
          ├── project_name.srcs/
          │   ├── sources_1/
          │   │   ├── bd/             # BDs are regenerated from script
          │   │   │   ├── my_bd/
          │   │   │   └── ...
          │   │   └── imports/hdl/    # BD wrappers are also regenerated
          │   │       ├── my_bd_wrapper.{v,vhd}
          │   │       └── ...
          │   └── ...
          └── ...
  ```

3. Initialize the git repository with `git init` on the Tcl Console. This will
  create the repository, automatically change to your project directory
  (`PROJECT_NAME`), generate the `.gitignore` file and stage it.

4. Stage your source files with `git add`.

5. When you are done, `git commit` your project. A `PROJECT_NAME.tcl`
  script will be created in your `PROJECT_NAME` folder and added to your commit.

  - **Note**: Always use the `-m` argument to pass your message when committing.
   This is needed because the Tcl Console on Vivado cannot handle terminal-based
   editors.

6. Afterwards, when opening the project after cloning it, do it by using
  `Tools -> Run Tcl Script...` and selecting the `PROJECT_NAME.tcl` file
  created earlier. This will regenerate a project for you to continue working.

### Sample project

Refer to the `reaction_timer` project under `sample` if you want an
example on how you can structure your project.

## Notes

### Block design support

If a block design is present, Tcl procedures will be integrated in the project
generator file to regenerate it. Make sure to specify it as `<Local to Project>`
when creating the Block Design with the GUI, so that it is created inside the
`vivado_project` directory.

The script will also automatically create and add the BD wrapper to the project.

The wrapper of the `.bd` file **must** be called `${bd_name}_wrapper`
(e.g. `my_awesome_bd_wrapper` if your BD is called `my_awesome_bd`),
which is the default when creating in the GUI with `Create HDL Wrapper...`.

The BD wrapper automatically generated by Vivado **must not** be tracked by Git.
If you need to manually modify the BD wrapper generated by Vivado,
you can write a handwritten wrapper to the generated wrapper and put only the
handwritten one under source control.

Also note that the layout information of the block design will not be kept.

### Board part and IP repositories paths

Only board part and IP repositories inside the project are stored in the project
generator script.

If you have a system wide board part or IP repository, you will need to add it
manually after recreating the project from the Tcl script
(e.g. via `Settings --> Board Repository`).
